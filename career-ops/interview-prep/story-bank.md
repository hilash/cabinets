# STAR+R Story Bank

Career Ops uses **STAR+R** — adding Reflection to the classic STAR format. The Reflection is what separates a rehearsed answer from a wise one.

## 1. The PLG Revenue Engine
**Competencies:** growth, data-driven, product strategy, revenue impact

- **S:** At DataPlatform, the self-serve tier was flat at EUR 120K MRR with no growth playbook.
- **T:** Build and execute a product-led growth motion to drive self-serve revenue without adding sales headcount.
- **A:** Mapped the full conversion funnel. Found that developers who made their first API call within 15 minutes had 4x higher conversion. Redesigned onboarding around "time-to-first-API-call." Built usage-based pricing nudges at natural expansion points. Partnered with Growth to instrument the entire funnel in Amplitude.
- **R:** Self-serve MRR grew from EUR 120K to EUR 380K in 12 months. Developer activation increased 34%.
- **Reflection:** I underestimated how much the pricing page itself was a conversion blocker. Next time, I'd start with pricing page experiments before touching the product.

**Best for:** "Tell me about driving growth" / "Product-led growth experience" / "Revenue impact"

## 2. The SDK That Developers Actually Liked
**Competencies:** technical depth, developer experience, cross-functional, shipping

- **S:** DataPlatform's SDK was functional but painful — 96 lines of boilerplate to make a basic API call. Developer satisfaction was 62%.
- **T:** Ship a v3.0 SDK across Python, Node, and Go that developers genuinely enjoy using.
- **A:** Ran developer diary studies with 15 users to map the friction points. Co-designed the API surface with a staff engineer, optimizing for "copy-paste-run" in under 5 lines. Built a code playground for testing before installation. Released beta to 50 developers and iterated on feedback before GA.
- **R:** SDK v3.0 shipped across three languages. Developer satisfaction jumped to 96%. Time-to-first-API-call dropped from 45 min to 8 min.
- **Reflection:** The diary studies were the highest-ROI research I've ever done. Developers describe their own problems differently than they experience them — watching the diary recordings caught things interviews missed.

**Best for:** "Developer experience" / "Technical product decisions" / "User research impact"

## 3. Building the Team From Scratch
**Competencies:** leadership, hiring, team building, scaling

- **S:** At BuildTools, I was the only PM for a product with 120K monthly active builds. The CEO wanted to scale the product org.
- **T:** Hire 3 PMs, establish team practices, and maintain product velocity during scaling.
- **A:** Wrote the PM job description based on the team's actual needs (not a generic post). Built a structured interview loop with a product critique exercise. Hired 3 PMs over 4 months — prioritized judgment and writing quality over tool-specific experience. Onboarded each with a 30-60-90 plan and assigned them a domain with clear boundaries.
- **R:** Team went from 1 to 4 PMs. All three hires were promoted within 18 months. The OKR process we established was adopted company-wide.
- **Reflection:** I over-indexed on speed for the first hire and got lucky. For the second and third, I added a "work together for a day" trial that gave me much better signal. I now think structured trials are more informative than any interview.

**Best for:** "Building a team" / "Hiring" / "Leadership experience" / "Scaling"

## 4. The Migration Nobody Wanted
**Competencies:** conflict resolution, technical leadership, stakeholder management

- **S:** BuildTools needed to migrate from a monolith to SOA. Engineering wanted to do a big-bang rewrite. Leadership wanted no disruption to customers. The two sides were stuck.
- **T:** Find a migration path that both engineering and leadership could commit to.
- **A:** Mapped the monolith into service boundaries based on change frequency and failure blast radius (not just code structure). Proposed a strangler fig pattern: extract one service at a time, starting with the lowest-risk, highest-value boundary. Built a customer communication plan that framed the migration as "reliability investment." Got buy-in by showing the first extraction could be done in one sprint as proof of concept.
- **R:** First service extracted in 2 weeks. Full migration completed over 6 months with zero customer-facing incidents. Engineering morale improved measurably.
- **Reflection:** The key insight was framing it as a product decision, not an engineering decision. When I showed leadership the reliability ROI in customer terms, the resistance disappeared. I should have done that framing first.

**Best for:** "Conflict resolution" / "Working with engineering" / "Technical decision-making"

## 5. The Feature That Got Killed
**Competencies:** saying no, data-driven decisions, prioritization, courage

- **S:** At StartupCo, the integration marketplace was our #1 most-requested feature and the primary reason enterprise customers upgraded. But the Jira integration specifically was consuming 40% of support tickets while only 12% of users used it.
- **T:** Decide whether to invest in fixing the Jira integration or deprecate it.
- **A:** Analyzed cohort data: Jira integration users had lower NPS and higher churn than non-Jira users (counterintuitive — the feature they asked for was making them unhappy). Proposed deprecation to the CEO with the data. Designed a migration path for affected users. Published a transparent blog post about why.
- **R:** Support tickets dropped 35%. The engineering team reclaimed 40% of their maintenance time. Three enterprise customers churned (as predicted), but overall retention improved.
- **Reflection:** This was the hardest product decision I've made. I was terrified of the customer reaction. What I learned: users ask for features that they think will solve their problem, but sometimes the feature IS the problem. Data doesn't make the decision less scary, but it makes it defensible.

**Best for:** "Saying no" / "Hard decisions" / "Data-driven prioritization" / "Killing a feature"

## How to Use

- **Before an interview:** Pick 3-4 stories that map to the role's likely competency focus (see Block F evaluation)
- **During:** Hit S in 1 sentence, T in 1 sentence, A in 3-4 sentences, R in 1-2 with numbers, R in 1-2 sentences
- **Total time per story:** 90-120 seconds
- **The Reflection:** Deliver it with honesty. "What I'd do differently" shows growth. "What I learned" shows pattern recognition.
